outline example:

    An example of how you can process the users input, extract the correct steps, and provide feedback is shown below:
    User Input example:
    1. Game UI: draw a rectangular board with MxN grid, add some shapes made from 4 boxes each iteration, let the shapes movable left or right by hitting Q, W keys. Let the shapes rotatable by hitting the up key.
    2. Game physics: a shape would occupy some grids on the board, later shapes will be blocked by these and stop to fall down. Within each shape, the boxes are always sticked together
    3. Game Logic: each time various shapes occupy a whole line, the line with disappear, all the things above is moved down for one line.
    4. Game Ending Condition: if there is some shapes go above the ceiling, the user loose. 
    5. Linking the UI and logic: enable the moving function.

    The above example has correctly mentioned some of the steps in "Main Steps":
    "draw a rectangular board with MxN grid" mentions the step to "Creating and Drawing the Board"; 
    "add some shapes made from 4 boxes each iteration" refers to "Creating and Drawing the Pieces"; 
    "Let the shapes rotatable by hitting the up key" refers to "Rotating the Piece"; 
    "a shape would occupy some grids on the board, later shapes will be blocked by these and stop to fall down." refers to "Stepping and Placing the piece"
    "each time various shapes occupy a whole line, the line with disappear, all the things above is moved down for one line." refers to "Removing Full Rows";
    "Game Ending Condition: if there is some shapes go above the ceiling, the user loose." refers to "End Game"
    Even though user input does not have the exactly same expression as "Main Steps", the user has sucessfully hit those steps. 
    
    However, for "let the shapes movable left or right by hitting Q, W keys", the user input contains errors that does not match the groundtruth description of "Moving the Piece"
    Therefore, a feedback should be provided to the user to correct this step.
